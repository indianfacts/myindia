            The holy city of Varanasi, also known as Banaras or Kashi, is believed to be one of the oldest living cities in the world. In fact, it is believed that this place was once the home of Lord Shiva and Goddess Parvati. 
            As Mark Twain puts it, Varanasi is “older than history, older than tradition, older even than legend, and looks twice as old as all of them put together.”This city’s connection with eternity doesn’t end here, for it is believed that the person who inhales his final breath here actually attains salvation. 
            This is why so many devout Hindus pilgrimage to Varanasi to spend their last days on Earth. At the same time, many other devotees flock to the city throughout the year to experience its divinity.
            If you’re visiting the city for he first time, I highly recommend this private half day tour to immerse yourself into Varanasi’s culture, history, and (tourist-friendly) street food!
            Also, Varanasi is a visually stunning city. From its architecture, its people, and rituals, every moment and every corner present a photo worthy capture. Make the most of this rich experience with this photo tour across the city.</p>

         <h1 class="heading">14. India is Famous for its Iconic Step Wells</h1>
         <p class="para">India’s abandoned step-wells, known as vavs in Gujarat and baolis (or baoris) elsewhere in northern India, are an important part of its history and architecture. 
            While information about them is scarce, they’re believed to have started appearing mostly between the 2nd and 4th centuries to supply water from the country’s deep water tables – especially in the hot, dry states in northern India.Beyond their primary use, they were often used to provide shade, as temples, community centers, and layovers on trade routes.
            Among the most stunning step wells is the Rani ki Vav (the Queen’s Step Well), which is undoubtedly India’s most awe-inspiring step well.
            It’s crazy to think that this UNESCO World Heritage site was just recently discovered.
            These step wells are best explored on a tour. Here are some of the best step well tours in the region.</p>
